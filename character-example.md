# Character Creation Example

In this document we'll create a sample character using some of the items defined in [Ability Examples](ability-example.md).

## A New Hero Arises

From the Actors tab in Foundry we'll click "Create Actor".  The powers we're going to give him are useful as examples but don't make a whole lot of sense together, so we're going to call him Mister Mismatch.  

The available actor types are Character, NPC, and Vehicle.  The only difference between Character and NPC is that tokens associated with the Character type default to being marked as Friendly and have the "Link to Actor" option enabled.  Vehicle is currently a placeholder for a vehicle sheet to be implemented later.  For this eaxmple, we'll choose "Character".

The <stats tab name?> tab is where you'll spend most of your time, but let's take a look a the other tabs first.

"Bio" covers mostly non-statistical information about the character - origins, gender/sexuality, career backgrounds, etc.  The only item here that needs to be filled out for some stat calculations to function is Weight - we'll put Mr. M. down as a fit but not brawny 150 pounds.

"Story", as the name suggests, contains a text block for entering longer backstory information, notes, etc.

Heading back to the <name> tab, we'll make Mister Mismatch a 100-point ("street level") hero and randomly allocate points to his base characteristics according to the guidelines in the rules, section <whatever>.  At this point we can see that a number of values, such as saving throws, have been calculated based on these stats.

## Adding Abilities

Now let's go to Foundry's items tab, grab each of the abilities created in [Ability Examples](ability-example.md), and drag them onto the character sheet.  They're now visible on the sheet, but need to be customized for our new character.  Before we do that, however, we'll click the "+Add" button over the Abilities section of the character sheet to create a new item, which we'll turn into a disadvantage to buy Mr. M some more points to play with.
