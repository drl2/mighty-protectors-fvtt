# Mighty Protectors System for FoundryVTT
A Villains and Vigilantes 3:  Mighty Protectors system implementation for Foundry VTT

This is the initial public release of this system, intended primarily for testing.  Near-future updates might change the underlying data model in ways that will break characters or items created under this version, so use at your own risk.

## Documentation
- [Creating powers/abilities for a compendium](ability-example.md)
- [Character creation example](character-example.md)

## The Game
[Mighty Protectors](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/220501/VV-30-Mighty-Protectors?affiliate_id=1692486) is the property of [Monkey House Games](https://monkeyhousegames.com/).  This system is an independent project unaffiliated with Monkey House.

## Goals
Targeted functionality for a version 1.0 release of this system includes:
- Character and vehicle sheets featuring automated stat calculations similar to those in the official [Excel Record Sheet](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/222459/Mighty-Protectors-Excel-Record-Sheet-Pack?term=mighty+protectors?affiliate_id=1692486) version of the character sheet.
- Initiative management that includes per-round re-rolls and support for multiple initiative entries for characters with super speed.
- Attack, Damage, and saving throw rolls based on stats & powers defined on the character/vehicle sheets.

Future versions may incorporate features such as optional further autmation of combat actions.

## Known issues
- The System Settings entries are clickable/selectable on the configuration screen but their functionality is not yet implemented.
- Creating a vehicle just adds a normal character sheet; the vehicle sheet has not been implemented yet.

## To Do, Short Term
- Implement vehicles
- Implement system-level settings options


## To Do... Maybe?
- Re-skinning/re-styling to look less like the generic Foundry character sheet?
- Replace or supplement default token status effect with Mighty-Protectors-Specific ones?
- More automation?  Potentially auto-apply damage on a hit when a target is selected; would require adding in some more intelligence around damage types, potential invulnerabilities, etc.

## Support
(Sigh) Well, since Discord seems to be the way to do things these days.... [Foundry Protectors Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VU98efBCuP)

## Contributing
Not currently in search of help with functional development, but would be interested in collaborating with someone with design skills and strong modern CSS knowledge on layout improvements.

The system is set up for multi-language support but is currently only in English; multi-lingual folks willing to translate lists of keywords are also welcome.

The project is free and open source, but if you'd like to contribute financially, feel free to make purchases through the [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/?affiliate_id=1692486) affiliate links above or this [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3kGDqgc).

- Initial public test release

## Acknowlewdgements

- Thanks to Jack Herman and Jeff Dee for releasing Mighty Protectors at pretty much exactly the time I was looking to get back into tabletop gaming after a many-year hiatus.  (In other words:  Jeff, this is *all your fault*!.)
- Thanks to all the folks on the League of Extraordinary FoundryVTT Developers discord for answering so many of my possibly sometimes inane questions.  (But I still despise Discord as a development support mechanism.)
- Thanks to Brian and the rest of the Tuesday night group for helping to keep the games going during Coronapalooza.
