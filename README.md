# Mighty Protectors System for FoundryVTT
A Villains and Vigilantes 3:  Mighty Protectors system implementation for Foundry VTT

This is the initial public release of this system.  


## Known issues
- The System Settings entries are clickable/selectable on the configuration screen but their functionality is not yet implemented
- Creating a vehicle just adds a normal character sheet; the vehicle sheet has not been implemented yet

## To Do, Short Term
- Implement vehicles
- Implement system-level settings options
- 


## To Do... Maybe?
- Re-skinning/re-styling to look less like the generic Foundry character sheet?
- Replace or supplement default token status effect with Mighty-Protectors-Specific ones?
- More automation?  Potentially auto-apply damage on a hit when a target is selected; would require adding in some more intelligence around damage types, potential invulnerability, etc.
